Column = 0
Define a function mower_moving and run it until a cell does not exist:
    While next cell exists:
        check if next cell mowed:
            If yes:
                Move forward
            If No:
                Start Mower
                Move forward
                Stop mower
Once cell does not exist:
    If column count is even, turn right and check for existing cell
        If next cell exists:
            +1 to column count, move forward, and turn right again
            Run mower_moving again
    If column count is odd, turn left and check for existing cell
        If cell exists:
            +1 to row count and move forward and turn left again
            Run mower_moving again
    If after the turn and check cell does not exist:
        End program
